# Post_Shock Resilience Analysis Dashboard 

## objective
This project analyzes how external shocks(health, economic, systemic)
impact the resilience of different countries. It computes baseline resilience scores, 
applies stimulated shocks, and presents post-shock results through simple dashboard.

## project Structure

## How it work
1.Backend logic(Python) calculates baseline resilience scores,
2. A shock model adjust the score.
3. Results are exported as structured JSON file.
4. The frontened dashboard displays the result.

## technologies used
-Python(backend logic)
-HTML, CSS,JavaScript(frontend)
-JSON(data exchange)

## output
The dashboard shows:
-Country name
-Baseline resilience score
-Post-shock resilience
-Impact explanation

## Future scope
-Live backend integration 
-Interacive chrts
Real-time data sources
